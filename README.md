# Transistor Garden Vite, React, Typescript Template

This template is my preferred starting point for building React web applications. It comes preloaded with packages that I use most often in my projects, as well as some additional tweaks to make things easier to use.

## Packages

- Material UI
- React Hook Form
- React Icons
- React Router Dom
- TailwindCSS, PostCSS & Autoprefixer

## Tweaks & Conventions

- _**Theme**_: ./src/theme is used to govern application wide color and font decisions. _theme.ts_ exports a _ThemeOptions_ object from Material UI. I recommend using [Zenoo's MUI Theme Creator](https://zenoo.github.io/mui-theme-creator/) to customize colors here. _bridge.cjs_ allows this theme to be consumed by TailwindCSS in _tailwind.config.js_. ( _I fussed with this for a little while, if you find a better way without the bridge.cjs file please submit a pull request!_ ðŸ˜… )
- _**Routing**_: I love routing with react-router-dom. Tons of flexibility and customization. I tend to abstract my routes to their own file to keep imports in _index.tsx_ under control - and I did just that here. This app only has two pages, but there is plenty of room for expansion.
- _**Host Port**_: I set this to 3000 because it's what I'm comfortable with.
